## Overview

The Shortened URL Application leverages a modern .NET Core 8 framework to provide a sleek and efficient solution for URL shortening. Designed with Clean Architecture, this application ensures a robust and scalable codebase. By adopting the Minimal API, the application offers high performance and maintainability. 

The application employs the following advanced design patterns and tools to enhance functionality and code organization:
- **Clean Architecture**: A modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes a clear separation of layers.
- **Repository Design Pattern**: Manages data access with repositories, ensuring a clean and abstracted data layer.
- **Mediator Design Pattern**: Facilitates communication between components, improving decoupling and flexibility.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Design Pattern**: Differentiates between commands and queries to optimize performance and scalability.
- **Mapster**: Efficiently maps entities to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for smooth data manipulation.
- **Fluent Validation**: Validates incoming requests with an intuitive and fluent API.
- **JWT for Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures secure access and user identity verification.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Provides fine-grained access control based on user roles.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture**: A structured and modular application design promoting separation of concerns.
- **Repository Design Pattern**: Abstracts data access, making it more maintainable and testable.
- **Minimal API**: Utilizes lightweight endpoints for efficient request handling.
- **Code First Approach**: Defines the database schema through code, allowing easy migrations and updates.
- **SQL Server**: Stores URLs in a robust and reliable database.
- **Carter Nugget Package**: Simplifies the Minimal API module organization.
- **Mapster for Entity Mapping**: Streamlines data transfer between entities and DTOs.
- **Fluent Validation**: Validates incoming requests to ensure data integrity.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secures endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Controls access based on user roles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [.NET Core 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or any compatible database provider.
